# WORK IN PROGRESS

This project consist of two programs:
* **assembler** (see below) for the [The Educational Computer, Model 1 (EC)](https://github.com/hryniuk/ec)
* **loader** (see below) for the [The Educational Computer, Model 1 (EC)](https://github.com/hryniuk/ec)

## Usage

### Assembler

```shell
usage: asm.py [-h] [--asm-file ASM_FILE]

Convert EC assembly to an ALF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --asm-file ASM_FILE  assembly file's path
```

### Linker

TBD

## About

### Assembler

The **assembler** transforms **assembly** code into **ALF** that can be run on
[EC](https://github.com/hryniuk/ec).


### Assembly

Assembly code consists of lines with instructions (see
[docs/instructions.md](docs/instructions.md)), at most one instruction per
line. Moreover each line may also include a comment, which is a fragment
starting from the `#` character.

A lot of examples (used as test files) can be found under `tests/` (EC assembly
file should end with `.easm` string).

#### Simple example

```
# set r0 to 5
LI,0x0 0x05

# Supervisor call with id = r0 = 5, i.e.
# write character at address 0x20 to the stdout
SVC,0x0 0x20,1 # writes 0, cause the whole memory is zeroed on EC start
```

### Loader

TBD
